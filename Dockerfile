# Build a self-contained image that serves THIS lab. It bases on the prebuilt
# Simspace runtime and swaps in your lab/ directory. The lab is loaded at
# runtime, so this is just a file copy — no app rebuild.

#   docker build -t my-lab .
#   docker run --rm -p 8080:80 my-lab      # open http://localhost:8080

# Pin RUNTIME_IMAGE to a released version for reproducible builds:
#   docker build --build-arg RUNTIME_IMAGE=dockersamples/simspace:1 -t my-lab .
